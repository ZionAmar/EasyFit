## ✨ Key Features

-   **👑 Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** Supports multiple studios within a single system. Each studio's data (members, trainers, rooms, schedule) is completely isolated.

-   **👥 Comprehensive User Management:**
    -   **Multi-Role System:** Clearly defined roles (`Owner`, `Admin`, `Trainer`, `Member`) with specific permissions.
    -   **Owner Dashboard:** A global view for the system owner to manage all studios, create new ones, and assign administrators.
    -   **Admin Dashboard:** A studio-specific control panel for managing members, trainers, rooms, and studio settings.
    -   **Role Switching:** Users with multiple roles (e.g., a trainer in one studio and a member in another) can easily switch between views.

-   **🗓️ Dynamic Scheduling & Booking:**
    -   Built with **FullCalendar** for an interactive and intuitive scheduling experience.
    -   Create, update, and delete classes (meetings).
    -   View schedule by month, week, or day.
    -   Automatic filtering of available trainers and rooms based on date and time to prevent scheduling conflicts.

-   **🎟️ Smart Waiting List:**
    -   When a class is full, members can join a waiting list.
    -   If a spot opens up, the first person in line is automatically notified and has a chance to book.
    -   If they decline or their time expires, the next person on the list is notified, ensuring classes are always full.

-   **📊 Studio Analytics & Overview:**
    -   The admin dashboard provides at-a-glance statistics, including the number of active members, classes scheduled for the day, and new members this month.

-   **⚙️ Resource & Settings Management:**
    -   Manage studio rooms, including capacity and equipment availability.
    -   Configure studio details and set weekly operating hours.

-   **🔐 Secure Authentication:**
    -   Uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure, session-based authentication.
    -   Passwords are encrypted using a salted hash for enhanced security.
